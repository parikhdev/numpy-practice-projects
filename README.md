# NumPy Practice Projects

# About This Repository

Welcome to my NumPy practice repository! 
This collection of Jupyter Notebooks serves as my personal log while learning the fundamentals of NumPy. 
The goal of this project is to document my progress and solidify my understanding of key array manipulation and mathematical concepts.

# Concepts Covered

The notebooks in this repository explore a variety of fundamental NumPy topics, including:

* Array Creation: Creating NumPy arrays from lists, using functions like `arange`, `zeros`, `ones`, and `linspace`.
* Array Attributes: Inspecting array dimensions (`ndim`), shape (`shape`), size (`size`), and data types (`dtype`).
* Indexing & Slicing: Accessing and modifying elements and subsections of arrays.
* Mathematical Operations: Performing element-wise arithmetic and using universal functions (ufuncs).
* Array Manipulation: Reshaping, stacking, and splitting arrays.
